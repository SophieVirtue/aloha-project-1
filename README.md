# Project 1

This is a website for a clothing company named Aloha.  
The project is (mostly?) responsive for phones, tablets, and laptops/desktops.
There is still some work to be done to perfect the page, but this took much longer than originally anticipated!
Looking forward to feedback while continuously working to improve the site.
